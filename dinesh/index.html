Cloud computing simply means storing and accessing data through internet instead of storing on computer hard drive. If we store our data in the hard drive it is called local computing. On the other hand Mobile computing is the technology that allows transmission of data, voice and videos by using the computer or any other wireless devices without having to be connected to a physical link. Mobile computing is a consumer or user facing technology while cloud computing is a business or company facing technology. Cloud computing is aimed at enterprise. Both cloud computing and mobile computing use wireless service to transmit data. Mobile cloud computing is a new platform combining the mobile devices and cloud computing to create a new infrastructure, whereby cloud performs the heavy lifting of computing-intensive tasks and storing massive amounts of data. In this new architecture, data processing and data storage happen outside of mobile devices</div>
